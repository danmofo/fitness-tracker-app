This is a personal fitness tracking app I'm building for myself.

I'm documenting my progress as I go along on my website:
- [Part 1](https://www.dmoffat.com/writing/2024/07/building-a-fitness-app-with-java-part-1)
- [Part 2](https://www.dmoffat.com/writing/2024/07/building-a-fitness-app-with-java-part-2)

## Developing

Some useful scripts:
- `./recreate-db`, deletes + recreates your local database
- `./migrate`, run database migrations
- `./server/generate-db-classes`, generates jOOQ models from the database

## Building
